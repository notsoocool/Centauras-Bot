in my final few months of graduate school my dissertation chair invited me to his hotel room while we were at a conference to talk about my work moments into our discussion i found that he was taking his pants off and wanted sexual intercourse i feared that he would no longer support me if i went against his wishes at the same time i worried that people i respected including my committee members would denigrate me and my work if it were known that i had had sexual intercourse with him i took on the situation as my own psychologically and continue to suffer deep emotional trauma from this experience i later ended up working with this same professor postgraduation on a major research project and while i had made clear that i was not interested in any sexual relationship with him he proceeded to engage in aggressive sexual harassment and sexual assault in his role as my supervisor once i settled into the job he began to routinely grope me at work he put his hands on my breast and or genitals whenever he could manage it he regularly commented on my body shape size and sex appeal he has verbally and physically threatened to rape me on several occasions at each meeting with him i anticipate i will be subject to some sort of sexual abuse or public ridicule because of my gender but he is my supervisor letter writer and a giant in my field this harassment is ongoing and while i want to file a complaint with my university i have been told by many colleagues and other women he has abused that the university does not care about me us it will always protects its cherished professors and i have watched closely as other complaints of sexual harassment and assault are poorly handled by my university and how each time the accuser lost and the accused often a professor was unharmed
mine is a hostile environment case a pattern of animus and obstruction of degree completion that ibut not a similarlysituated male colleagueexperienced the male colleague and i had nearly identical committees including the same dissertation chair and were at the same stage i e ready for defense and graduation one of our reading committee members tl withheld his signature so that i could not set a final defense date and insisted on reviewing my statistical analyses in detail however tl allowed the male colleague to set a defense date august with no prior review of his statistical analyses during junejuly i endured four hour meetings with tl reviewing statistical printouts at one point taking a phone call and asking the unknown caller whether they thought my analysis strategy was stupid tl demanded that i conduct analysis and put them in the dissertation then at the next meeting hed insist i take them out another committee member cl who held a joint appointment in the statistics department had no concerns with either my analysis strategy or findings i reached a breaking point in late july when another faculty member intervened with my dissertation chair who evidently talked tl into allowing me to set a defense date the defense date august required me to change my travel plans id accepted a job miles away and was flying out to begin teaching in late august my defense ran nearly three hours most other students defenses were less than two hours and when the committee called me back into the room tl said twice congratulations dr name of male colleague tl demanded additional changes that required me to register and pay for fall quarter tuition and when i sent them he delayed reviewing the final document so long that i feared id have to fly back for a second defense the university required another defense if the final document was submitted after more than days in the end it cost me a gigantic hit to my selfesteem and an incredibly stressful start to my new job about years later he pulled the same routine with another female student who asked him to chair her committee she documented every nasty comment and discriminatory action and he was eventually removed as her chair
this prominent history professor had started to take me under his wing and we would meet frequently to talk about my research ideas there was a barely noticeable sexual vibe during our meetings so i just brushed it off i was just starting my phd program and getting the support from this man meant a whole lot one time we met to discuss my summer research plans and i told him i needed to get funding he proceeded to ask how much money i needed and offered to pay for it i was completely shocked and confused not knowing how to respond a red flag went off in the back of my mind because i felt that accepting his personal money would move the relationship in a more personal direction i quickly thanked him but said that there was no need because i was applying for department funding something told me to stay away from this man and i eventually changed my research topic not necessarily directly related to this i always felt weird about this incident and there was no one i could process it with was i just really lucky should i have taken the money was he just that vested in my research would his wife also a prominent professor on campus know about this would it be a gift coming from both of them i havent processed this with any of my grad program friends because they all work with this man and they all see him as an academic father figure its a small weird episode but i share it because this man is a powerful force at my institution and this is the only place where i feel safe sharing it
over a few years after undergrad and before graduate school i was in some kind of relationship with my undergrad advisor i worked on his field project abroad so he was also my boss and only source of income he told me things like youre the smartest person ive ever known and then you dont have what it takes to get a phd i later learned he was in an exclusive relationship with another professor at the school and tried to sleep with multiple other undergrads i was in therapy three times for this once during my first year of grad school when i cut off communication with him and he began to stalk me at school in another state once with my current partner due to related panic attacks and most recently after realizing symptoms of ptsd now mostly recovered
a friend of mine was creeped on by a fellow undergrad who just would not stop touching her hed spot her and go and grab her waist or poke her or stand closer and closer until he fell against her or any of this all the time this was like twice a week for a year every single time either she was like stop it or she sharply moved away and he never got the idea she eventually went to the womens lgbt resource center on campus for help but the guy was not even pulled into anyones office for a talking to
my colleague arrived at the door of my office and when i said hello and asked him what i could do for him he replied i want you to have sex with another colleague i didnt answer just looked at him in shock he laughed and was clearly waiting for me to laugh with him i wasnt sure what to do or say and in retrospect im glad i didnt laugh along with him because then he could say he was just joking and i thought it was funny too another colleague overheard it and didnt say anything supportive which i kind of understand we were both intimidated
i lived at an interdisciplinary graduate facility during my ma a male ph d student who i knew quite well raped sexually assaulted and sexually harassed at least four or five women one of whom is a close friend of mine while he lived at the facility and worked through his program it took a year and a half after these students reported the incidents before the university in question expelled him and that was in part because a news segment about this was about to be released on canadian national television
during a dance composition class the professor instructed my partner to slap my but during a lift my pelvis was on my partners shoulder the whole class laughed during a job interview i was instructed to not wear high heels to work how the professor looked at me made me feel uncomfortable he also didnt pay me on time and i had to demand payment he said that part of the program was a criminal retraining program i ended up feeling like a criminal after working there for a few weeks i found out that he just got hired as a professor at the same university that i was attending a fellow student commented on my ass as i was walking out of class not that it really matters but i wasnt even wearing something that was tight i was kissed on my hand while working on a group project outside of the classroom during class time by a person that i was dating i felt embarrassed like i had no choice in the interaction everything happened so fast and i didnt know what to say or how to say no because it was in public and i didnt want to draw attention to myself
bullied by my older male supervisor mocking me yelling at me glaring at me over monthslong period
professor removed everyone from an upperlevel graduate seminar but me by saying they didnt meet prereqs whereas i had essentially no choice but to take the course in order to meet graduation requirements so it was a class of one although it probably should have been canceled per university regulations it was awkward if mostly ok until he decided that we needed to spend a session studying erotic art together even though it was only tangential to the main subject of the seminar it was not an art class and he was not an art professor usually we sat opposite each other in the seminar room or he lectured from the front but this time he sat right next to me with art books and even pointed out the penises in the images oh i have the noncensored version of that painting right here
a colleague on the first day of my job showed me texts with another male colleague discussing me in the conversation they discussed my attractiveness and discussed that x colleague who was showing me his phone should date me in it they acknowledge i am married and therefore off limits but never that this is inappropriate these interactions continued and i felt unsure what to do because it was never a quid pro quo situation but one that was clearly meant to make me feel uncomfortable on the last day of that academic year upon entering this colleagues group office he asked why do you always wear shirts that make me look at your tits i left in shock the colleague apologized at the opening of the following school year
one of the senior staff in our group a senior lecturer had sex with his phd student and then employed her in the group this was against the staff code of conduct clearly and this was discussed and joked about my other males in the group ie you know how to get ahead ladies etc it was also revealed by other men in the group that this was not the first time the staff member had done this and that one of his female phd students had transferred to another faculty after she refused his advances and he stopped helping her

repeated comments on the dress bodies and dispositions of female students in a public common space designated for graduate teaching assistants often in the presence of undergraduate nonmajors
my first semester of the phd my cohort was required to take a professional seminar class taught by the director of the graduate program i cant remember why but this was around the time that jennifer lawrence and other female celebrities nude photos were leaked on the internet so the professor brought it up in class he was essentially victim blaming lawrence saying she shouldnt have taken the photos if she didnt want people to see them a female friend raised her hand and said that lawrence was an adult who took the pictures and sent them in the context of a consensual relationship and her privacy was violated by the pictures being shared with the public the professor responded by asking her in front of the whole class if she took nude photos of herself and shared them with romantic partners we were all so stunned and disgusted but no one piped up to tell him how gross of a comment that was another friend was his ta for a semester and he repeatedly made passes at her and commented on the level of attractiveness of job candidates who had come to do job talks
a female professor made an accusation of plagarism in a paper i turned in as a college freshman when i met with her in her office she made a pass at me touching my hair my shoulder and then further suggesting that she was available to tutor me at her home or mine and private tutoring would positively impact my grade
me and fellow students often got remarks on our physical characteristics often got stared by male professors
at a department gathering i wore a skirt and the first thing a male prof said to me was that he appreciated being able to see my legs one of the only other times ive worn a skirt he made a similar comment about in the hallway outside his office there was also a sense among women graduate students that he was prone to inappropriate comments a rumor that he had an affair with a grad student and he would often talk about his marriage in inappropriate settings a different professor in the same department told me to serve a visiting scholar coffee at our weekly coffee clatch i organized the coffee with a male grad student who was also there but of course he didnt ask my friend to serve the other scholar i declined the same professor introduced my writing partner and i who work on women and gender at a small conference hosted by our department the previous few papers had been about animals and he said so speaking of animals our next paper is title of paper that included the word women
when i joined my advisors lab i quickly noticed that i was being treated differently from my other male colleagues i was often asked to make copies go pick up coffee and other secretarial duties then it progressed to comments on my attire and long nights alone spent in his office because i required according to my advisor extra attention from there the conversations escalated to questions on my sexual preferences and needs and casual touching of the shoulder hand or thigh if i avoided the conversations or tried to leave the situation i was accused of not taking my work seriously this was the first time i reported him i was told that to make a formal accusation would mean i would lose the time and work i had put in and would have to leave the program we were encouraged to hug it out and work out our differences this was fuel for the fire after my first report things moved quickly soon after i was raped and felt stuck in an abusive environment i did everything i could to graduate as quickly as possible and start a new job away from my abuser but it took years to actually break free

i went to the restroom on the floor of my building where my department was located went into the stall closed the door and sat down i had taken a magazine with me within just a minute of sitting down i heard the restroom door open and someone walk in i paid no attention since it was a public restroom with several stalls and urinals i am male and it was a mens restroom after a few seconds i heard nothing and had a weird feeling looking up from my magazine i saw that the person was peeping through the crack between the stall door and the doorframe staring at me i asked him to leave but he continued to stand there staring i again asked him to leave and again he stood there staring finally i yelled for him to get out but he only backed up continuing to stare at the stall i was in i yelled again and he took off running out the door before this incident this same person would stop whatever he was doing when i walked by and stare at me with a completely blank look on his face that had happened dozens of time i went to my department and told our receptionist who was a good friend and she demanded that we report it to his supervisor
he picked me out of a crowd at the universitys graduation ceremony my first schoolwide event immediately started flirting and followed me out to my car saying dont let people see were talking theyll get the wrong idea a huge shiteating grin on his face i dismissed it as odd but looking back that was a gigantic red flag why would you even think to say that a casual friendship progressed to constantly asking me out through many no s he would corner me in an empty hallway and tell me how beautiful i was and that id regret not going on a date with him details of his current evidently prolific sex life and how hed pull younger women i was and he was my dismissal of his interest just made him come on stronger the most egregious incident was after i went to lunch with him he tried to kiss me in the parking lot of the school in the close quarters of his car i pushed him away hes and muscular so i consider myself lucky that he didnt push further than that he claimed another employee had a crush on him and was jealous of me i have no idea if this was true i do know he was using the story to try to emphasize how lucky i was that he was paying me attention i e that some women would fall over backwards for him but he was choosing me he emphasized that last part rather often that despite all the other women he was seeing and bedding hed drop them for me in an instant i had heard from other women that he was known for this sort of thing though i dont know to what extent i know he had asked out my predecessor as well she had warned me its one of the reasons i never reported it to the school i knew he was more valuable to them than i was so why bother forprofit school awful corporate administration i was at this school less than a year so all this occurred in a pretty compressed timeframe he got engaged and brought in his new fiancee shortly before i left i still wonder if maybe he had been dating her the whole time which in some ways adds another layer of yikes to the whole thing

he was a visiting professor at my university who returned later to a neighboring institution it was wellknown that he hit on his students especially the undergrads i dont know how much these lopsided power relations were consensual but i have always felt uncomfortable that i remained silent only much later did i realize how widespread this kind of behavior was by him as well as by several other male faculty in the departments he visited at both institutions its clear that his sexual comeons to his students were part of a pattern of harassment that both departments universities tolerated male students even the lackluster ones were mentored by him meanwhile almost all the female students especially the smartest ones he tried often successfully to have sex with this division of attentions permeated interactions well beyond his specific affairs but he was not the only faculty member in those departments to abuse trust and practice inegalitarian treatment of their students

a decade ago i was a new tenure track faculty member the tenured male professor next to me routinely met with his women students with his door shut i overheard many conversations with inappropriate sexual innuendo and several incidents of long moments of silence in the office one day i recognized one of my own students voices a few weeks later i overheard a conversation he had with the union rep about the fact that the student had filed a complaint i never heard anything more about it except that he is still teaching here but he doesnt close his office door anymore the student dropped out of school
this is a minor incident but creeped me out nonetheless and the way in which some colleagues blindly admire this guy has me experiencing cognitive dissonance and doubting my own instincts i was teaching in a prestigious program on campus that had been directed by the same faculty member for about years the program is much resented because he controls it tightly and brags about how it takes only the best students but he only lets some people teach in it i was admitted to this select company but by means of various indications knew my place was to stay quiet and not challenge him a few years later at a graduation dinner with free drinks this man came closer than i felt comfortable and then for no apparent reason placed his hand on my lower back i moved away shortly thereafter he retired

when i was a grad student a group of us older grads and younger faculty but some and somethings too from various universities went out for drinks and food after a conference reception it was probably pm we were in an upscale chain place in a major city the bulk of the group were from a particular university a married associate prof male hot shot in field had a grad student on his lap his advisee not yet abd both were pretty drunk and they started making out it was pretty uncomfortable for all of the rest of us we were waiting for food tho and a group of us promptly left i was with a few other female grads and female committee member of mine and she was mid s at that point we discussed how fucked up that was i had a coauthor who had been a grad student in that program and they told me that this faculty member did hot tub parties regularly with undergrads slept with grads etc a couple years later i brought this up to a good friend who was this guys advisee she knew nothing of it and i believe her i felt weird about telling her about it now fast forward at least years and the grad student left the program but did publish with him hes still a big name i have no idea if he and his wife had an agreement about infidelity and im still not totally sure to what degree this was wrong but it isnt like he could write her a recommendation letter right i feel weird around him
i was assaulted by a faculty member while at a summer music conference in
as an one of five female undergrads working at a remote field camp one summer i dealt with a bunch of behavior from one of the two senior male pis that made me very uncomfortable the pi in question encouraged heavy drinking among all at the camp and would give the women in the camp shoulder rubs unsolicited hugs etc he was very charismatic so at the time it was possible to laugh it all off but it never felt quite right there were about of us in total at the camp and we slept in one big bunk room i can remember him sometimes coming into the bunk room late leaning over my bunk when i seemed to be asleep and giving me a goodnight kiss blech he also regularly made inappropriate misogynistic statements i dont know why women have children their asses never look the same again this was my first field job as an ecology student the other senior pi also male turned a blind eye to this behaviour he was very focused on his science the grad students other research associates at the camp went along with the atmosphere created by the first pi no doubt because they were also walking a fine line between being in his good vs bad books
although this may not be a sexual harassment case but i would like to share i was harassed multiple times by my phd advisor he always told me my work wasnt good enough although it was accepted in topranked ieee conferences and he was bragging about it to other professors in the field i moved with my family to another city with his permission to do an internship and only return to defend my thesis however after i moved across the country he changed his mind and said he could do that because i didnt have anything in writing from him he demanded that i move back and do another term of research even though i had a fulltime job offer waiting for me and my thesis was approved for defense by committee members he delayed my work visa and i was about to lose my fulltime job offer after my defense although committee members were all satisfied with the changes i made to my thesis he demanded a lot more work and never agreed to sign the paperwork to let me graduate even after graduation he contacted me many times

i was years old my drum instructor tried to kiss me i have no indication that i wanted that ever
i experienced several interactions with my boss supervisor as harrassment on one of our conference trips he said good night to me by touching my hip and giving me a kiss on the cheek during another trip i was staying in one appartment with him and other colleagues we had separate rooms but shared a bathroom one night when i came out of the bathroom he was standing there only in a tshirt and his boxershorts i just said good night and went to my room another colleague of mine same job position once told me about the following incident that happened to her because he had taken over some work for her she said that she owed him something then he said that he could think of something but this would be inappropriate he often commented on our outfits one colleague was asked why she did not wear skirts and told us to use our charme for achieving some things e g when doing interviews this all happened between and
a professor for whom i was taing started inviting me to get happy hour drinks on occasioni took it as friendly and supportive at first then he started hugging me goodbye lingering longer and longer each time culminated with him texting me over a holiday break about how he couldnt stop thinking about me
a chair at the university i attended and worked at sexually harassed me and three other student works at the library we all worked at he would grab us brush up against us and stare at us while we worked
there was a well known professor in my department who was known for his constant sexual innuendos and comments in some ways it was considered part of his charm by many but it was super uncomfortable for most females in the room the sexual jokes comments were always gendered i e he never made them about males it wasnt uncommon for him to make comments about the weight or physical appearance of students in an approving or disapproving way i remember walking in his office and him frequently looking females up and down and then commenting on their appearance
a colleague was sexually harassed by her doctoral adviser he tried to get her to sleep with him and when she refused reminded her that her future was in her hands
the first year of my graduate program in geography another graduate student in my cohort would stare at me especially at my breasts every time we were in the same room together even if we werent near each other and i was talking to someone else from across the room he would be staring at me this would happen at social events in seminar in department meetings it was pretty constant
i was abd doing research at a small archive which had given me a fellowship part of the fellowship included free residence on site adjacent to the archive the archive and residence were in rural pennsylvania and at the time i was in residence only i and the livein academic director of the archive a more senior male abd from another institution were living on site one other full time staff person was on site during the day but i was told not to bother her the male director started off nice enough but over the course of my month long fellowship started to make comments about my weight my appearance and the appearance of the female high school student who worked a few days a week comments escalated to things about how lucky or whipped my male partner must be to put up with me and when another male fellow arrived who was polite and friendly comments about how we must be having an affair the man making the comments was the person administering my fellowship and the residence was isolated in a rural area without doors that locked so i decided to leave early i explained the situation to my dissertation director who was supportive once he found out the details but advised against reporting to the archives board of trustees because it would either do nothing or prevent me from getting future funding while the man who harassed me was still at the archive i told all the women intending to work there about what happened to me and most experienced similar he has since left the position
the faculty member pretended to have an interest in mentoring me instead one evening he propositioned me groped me and forcibly kissed me
i served as a ta for him it was a large lecture class and so he had to wear one of those microphones that clip on and are attached to a little battery pack most classes he would accidentally drop the battery pack in his pocket before turning the mic on he had a tremor so there was a plausible excuse but he would ask me a to unbutton his shirt to clip the microphone on properly and then b reach into his pocket to take out the battery pack and turn it on i was then expected to put it back into his pocket this felt super weird and creepy but i went with it because he made it clear that there wasnt another choice sometimes during class he would ask me to step outside of the classroom with him into this little vestibule hed put his hand on my arm look deep in my eyes tell me that it was time for a break and he was going to head to his office and to tell the students to come back expect him back in minutes i dont know whether this was a proposition or not but the physical contact alone during the conversation was super weird
i know of an incident involving a female graduate student and a male assistant professor the professor used a social media chat platform to make sexually explicit very explicit comments about the student and other female students in the department the students spouse found the chat and emailed it all over campus the student said it was mutually consensual and nothing was done about it she left the program
inappropriate touching sexual commentary inquiries about personal sexual preferences
i am glad to report as a graduate student in the s that i had great female mentors and did not experience harassment directly my friend though said that one of the senior professors in our department stared at her in his office and made her very uncomfortable sometime later i asked this senior member to be on my masters exam committee as he had knowledge of my field and he was very harsh during the exam and made the other two less senior female professors feel that their input was less important during their discussion after i left the room he disclosed that he did not want me to continue in the program even though i had done well and excelled at it but i had written a paper that was subpar for one of his classes and never rewrote it i wound up feeling like a dud and not very smart for years even though i was allowed to continue to the phd level i wound up getting stubborn and wanted a caring smart person like me to succeed in academia i am now a tenured professor but i was very fragile during those graduate school days
about yrs ago i shared an office with a wellknown middleaged professor who occasionally taught in the department it started with complaints about his marriage and i was appalled by overtly sexist things he would say to female undergraduates during office hours eg did your boyfriend help you with this by feb he began to kiss the top of my head when exiting the office then one day he kissed my neck with an open mouth many other grad students told me that they felt similarly harassed by him
someone came into my ofgice while i had stepped out momentarily and drew a penis on my wall with red ink
i was a graduate student assigned to a professor who was known to make a move on his tas also there were male grad students who received assistantships only they put me with him knowing who he was i was called in to the grad directors office a man and he told me to watch my back and to be careful he said sometimes you just have to take one for the team when i asked why i was assigned to him we went all semester without an incident no inappropriate comments no groping no moves then it was finals and we were grading in his office and it started i said i needed to go that i had a thing and would take my portion home to grade and have them to him soon i tried to get out of there as fast as i could he walked me to the main office and just as i was going to turn the corner to enter the office he grabbed my by the shoulders and tried to kiss me i ducked as fast as i could and made it a point to never be alone with him again thank god this was my last semester of eligibility and i was moved to grad instructor status after that
senior prof in my college was in the lodge asking about the programme for a graduation ceremony the following day one of the porters asked him why do you want to go to that anyway to which he replied so that i can leer at the attractive mothers its not assault or misconduct but it does create a hostile environment towards women
i interviewed for a tenure track equivalent position at a museum one of my individual interviews was scheduled with the year old senior man whose office would be beside mine should i get the job the male search chair went into the interview with me which seemed odd then within minutes the senior man mentioned how he thought it was strange that his female research assistant didnt like when he put his hand on her thigh why did he bring that up in an interview why did he bring that up at all the search chair went into the room to protect me i guess but it was still creepy
i had a sexual relationship with my m a advisor that was initiated by him he was wellknown to have affairs with students and in hindsight he obviously groomed me
i was working in an open office environment with low moveable walls separating our computer work areas from each colleague we were all lecturers at a private quite exclusive university i was one of women working with men one man had a very one of the lads way of interacting with the other men with myself and the other woman he chose not to interact at all we were invisible which because of his attitude and aggressive nature was fine by us he would bicycle into work each day and strip down to only his underpants wipe his armpits and chest with a towel and change into his work clothes for the day in his cubical area remember this is an openconcept office the cubical was just low moveable walls no door we were all witness to his morning habits i asked him twice to please change in the sideoffice the one we used for consultations with students during work hours he refused stating that we were all adults and in any case i was married and familiar with the male human body i had to resort to telling the head of our group who in turn asked my coworker to stop it his response he confronted me and said i was upsetting the harmony in the office i wish my male coworkers had stepped in as well im not angry that they didnt however im certain their input would have yielded better results there were other similar oneoftheboys type incidents pretty much daily too many to catalogue one that does stand out is the day he had brazilian models doing a runway show blaring from his computer calling all the men over to have a look they were all crowded around and when i came in the coworker showing the video said i didnt need to be there it wouldnt be my kind of thing the crowd of guys quickly dispersed as soon as i arrived i think they were embarrassed and im certain they felt bad yet they didnt call him out on his behaviour again i wish they had and yes this is in an academic higher education environment
i was standing with a group of colleagues in a common area of the department chatting casually a very senior famous colleague was standing next to me he put his arm around me in an apparent gesture of bonhomie or collegiality and his hand went down to my waist he then pinched my waist hard it was gross and humiliating and i felt violated i just put up with it because i didnt want to make a fuss this was after i had learned i hadnt gotten tenure so there was no reason not to alienate him but letting things go was so ingrained in me from junior professorhood and being a grad student that i didnt even think to protest i put up with so much sexism and saw so much racism in that department that this was just only a tiny step beyond business as usual it was disgusting
it was the early s i was still very young just turned i am trans f m and was publicly identifying as male but not at all passing as such and thus super visibly queer a student the year below me an army officer who came t to class in uniform started with inappropriate comments after class at social functions etc comments about what he imagined my sex life to be about how much he knew i would enjoy a night in the locker room with him and his buddies he got more graphic and threatening over time
i was working as a research tech while applying to grad school jokingly i said id take on any project to publish a paper to make my application better my advisor called me a slut in front of another tech said tech male later brushed it off as nonsexual when i vented to him this was the beginning of a very very bad relationship with my advisor
in the middle of a class discussion on early th century sociology the professor proclaimed to the entire class that i was sexy despite my being older than the rest of the students this prof revels in his academic rebel persona and enjoys making outrageous heavyhanded and unpc remarks often calling out students and engaging them in silly ridiculous conversation related to some personal characteristic name state or country of origin family status religion hobbies etc usually its all in good fun but slightly uncomfortable awkward this was the first time in this class however he made a comment toward anyone that was sexual in nature i was so shocked that i gasped and laughed in surprise but after the shock passed really resented that he verbalized the idea that im some hottie latina milf i believe the professor actually thought he was complimenting me however now i always wonder what other students faculty think of me and whether my intellectual credibility is overshadowed by my appearance ethnicity i feel i constantly have to overcompensate intellectually while repressing personal expression to counteract any stereotypes that were raised reinforced by that comment its exhausting

various issues across the department tenured faculty member has sent emails describing other colleagues in the department inappropriately putting down the work of female colleagues commenting on female colleagues weight and appearance even commenting that a new tt faculty was hired only for diversity this person also pounded his fists on a table in a meeting and yelled this is your job at me i was the only woman in the room and no one else said anything a different tenured faculty said that i didnt contribute to a collegial environment and that i should bake cookies and bring them in i was stalked last year and upon this news being shared internally i was mocked by a tenured faculty told that i would be targeted first if they made it on campus and then suggested i was targeted because of what i was wearing this faculty member then told me that i should pay for my own security protection out of my own paycheck when a colleague brought issues of gender discrimination forward to her department chair he said that it wasnt sexism and refused to assist in investigating the formal complaint
i was invited for an oncampus interview at an r school in the midwest during one of the oneonone interviews an associate dean moved his chair next to mine and put his hand on my leg i was shocked and humiliated and didnt say anything at the time

i was raped in a fraternity house my roommate left while it was happening
i cant count the number of times i was harassed by my former department chair he is older than my father the first time i walked in his office as a faculty member candidate he looked me up and down commented on how nice i looked and asked about my marital status this was his greeting i was so uncomfortable it should have been a red flag over the years he asked me my opinion on threesomes and shared that he and his wife have an open relationship he once hosted a mandatory department meeting party at his home and billed it as a pool party when i didnt come with my swim suit he said he was really disappointed in me because he had been looking forward to seeing me in a bathing suit all day after wrapping up a faculty meeting he once asked me when my husband was going to knock me up and mused on how my body would look when i was pregnant this was in front of another male colleague who laughed and agreed theses are just a few instances there was something every time we saw each other i actively avoided him
i got involved in a sexual romantic relationship with a staff member who was also using their position at the university to benefit their own private business a music festival when i declined to participate further in their private business activities i was told they would burn me to the ground i was followed parked next to faced discrimination in my student affairs and other non provable problems in my life i filed police reports with the university nothing was done i anonymously contacted the aclu

some examples a lecturer who i had never spoken to drunkenly groped me at a department happy hour it was well known that he sexually harassed students in the masters program he coordinated after a number of years his contract was not renewed it turned out he was also harassing faculty members in the department my advisor talked negatively about a female postdoc in my department and how she dressed too fashionably it made me always second guess what i wore and if i would be taken seriously a male collaborator at a national lab made it a point to mentor my male colleagues and talk science with them whereas with me he never discussed anything scientific and would strike up awkward conversations about things like what to do if a woman starts crying in your office or wondering if women wore socks or not at a conference dinner a respected senior professor told sexist jokes to myself and female grad students a member of my research group who was more senior to me said that if we ever made a research group nude calendar id need extra big items to cover up my boobs he framed it in the context of i know youre cool so i can say this to you but in reality it made me feel really uncomfortable being ignored in group meetings i would say something and no one would acknowledge it then a man would say it and they would i have lots of friends with far worse stories than this for me it was lots of small things that made me feel like i wasnt respected or didnt belong
cohortmate with whom i had a close relationship subjected me to repeated phone calls stalking including showing up at my apartment unannounced creating scenes at social events when i didnt pay enough attention to him and trying to turn mutual friends against me when i chose to date other people instead of him many people witnessed this behavior and he was never seen as anything more than lovesick and not handling it well because he was such a nice guy when confronted about his behavior he told me he felt he deserved to date me because he had put so much effort into our friendship
campus my senior colleague a full professor was continually remarking about my appearance my style of dress my weight he sent quasipornographic clearly inappropriate videos to myself and other people in the department and then would ask us to watch them while he was present there were rumors that the aa would no longer let him work unsupervised with female office assistants all of whom were undergraduate i remember on various occasions he would touch me in weird places my collar bone my ankle it was not overtly sexual but creepy some of my senior female colleagues would tell him to stop commenting about my physical appearance and he would say that he would and then would come and make comments to me and add in a hushed whisper but dont tell so and so because they think that i am harassing you i was in my second year as an assistant faculty member he had been a full professor for at least ten the computer services person started flirting with me over email i knew him because i had also taught a fitness class and he was in it i didnt think anything of it it eventually escalated to where he was sending me pornographic photos not of himself but of women it was all pitched as us being friends etc as it turns out this was a pattern that he had with many women on campus mostly other staff to my knowledge i was the only faculty person i have spent years dodging this man on campus yet every time he sees me he says hello and i very rarely go into the campus computer store without making sure that hes not there
i was told to smile when i looked upset which i was walking back into my office

in january i was participating in a meeting for a committee that ive been a member of since its inception we had a new interim president who came to the meeting to discuss his ideas when he entered the room he went around the table introducing himself to everyone he skipped over me im not faculty professional staff so im unfortunately used to that he came back around and stopped behind me before i had the chance to turn around he placed his hands on my shoulders and started massaging them while talking to the other members of the committee i froze i had never met this man there were faculty all tenured in the room as well as law enforcement who are part of the committee nobody said or did anything i did not report it because he was the new president he was essentially a political appointment brought in to drastically cut spending at the institution he was very connected politically and despite the witnesses i knew the only outcome would be my termination i reported it to my boss male but he didnt do anything or offer to do anything
as an undergraduate i worked closely in a onetoone mentoring relationship with a older male professor i thought of his as my campus dad the day i graduated i had a meeting with him he gave me a gift then confessed that he had been in love with me for almost the entire time he knew me he told me exactly when he fell in love with me he then came to my hometown a week later he told me that he needed to get away and it wasnt about me when he was in my small hometown i hid in my house he texted me photos of where he was throughout the day he still texts me on my birthday and on holidays six years later even though i have never replied to him in retrospect there were two things that i found odd during our meetings but i ignored them he once touched my hair and he once asked me to pick him up from the airport thats over three years so it didnt seem significant

a senior professor planted his mouth on mine in an area outside our offices that was technically public but because of complicated labyrinthine architecture nobody was around the universitys handling of my complaint involved aspects of insensitivity incompetence and humiliation that were a form of secondary victimization and perhaps retaliation at a major conference of my professional organization i attended a session at which the prof from incident had been scheduled to present he was removed from the program at the last minute because of additional complaints against him i was approached by a senior colleague in my field to say that some people were concerned that i had attended the session and were worried i had done so to cause trouble i learned that i was further criticized it still is not clear to me exactly what the criticism was since the harasser was not even there
in fall my sophomore year i enrolled in a class taught by an african american male faculty member who had a reputation for sexually harassing female students as i was african american and his previous targets had all been white i assumed i was safe around midterm he insisted i was too advanced for the topic hed assigned most of the class for a final paper and would need to meet with him in private to devise a topic for me i knew that private meetings with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women thus i spent the remainder of the semester insisting i was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic finally realizing that if i failed to write a paper because i had no assigned topic i could be flunked i explained my dilemma to another legitimately advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me adding i would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism she agreed i thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of b or above less than that and i felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct as i was a wellknown wellliked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization the professor had been brought up on sexual harassment charges the previous year but managed to elude censure by painting himself a victim of racism a claim that would be much harder to make in my case i received a b for the course so felt no need to take matters further the following semester however the professor flagged me down one day in the student union he was seated with the girl whod shared her topic with me and her boyfriend another of the profs advanced students the prof proceeded to inform me hed been so impressed by my term paper that he wanted to meet with me to discuss the possibility of collaborating on its publication at that point i loudly informed him i was no longer his student told him exactly what i thought of him and marched off

while i was working i had an older man looked to be in his s or s tells me that he couldnt sleep at night without me beside him in his bed and asked if i would come home with him i was absolutely disgusted that a man would say that to me as a child
one time a man told my coworker that she should wear her name tag on her shirt so that he could stare at her chest another time a drunk customer almost took his pants off in the middle of the store after she refused his advances
i was use to how the guys acted but being cornered in the small produce cooler by a rather large coworker was not something i was looking forward to he would not let me pass and believe me there was no way around him he began putting his hands on me and pulling me towards him as if to kiss then showed me his penis i had to show him i was carrying a pocketknife so that he would leave me be to be female in food service you have to have a thick skin you have to endure the sexism and the insulting jokes you have to work twice as hard as any man does just to show that you are not being a female
i was working at petsmart a few years back a male customer probably in his mid s was leering at me any time i was alone hed walk past me and say meet me outside eventually i had to go to the back to get something and i was so terrified that i had to grab a manager to accompany me in case the man tried to follow me eventually he left the store but his leering and insistence was terrifying
at a breakfast diner chain my manager put his arm around me and tried to kiss me one morning when i handed him a coffee when i reported it human resources required him to watch a sensitivity video and gave me a tencent raise
at that diner a cook trapped me in the cooler and groped me
a customer followed me to the parking and almost wouldnt let me leave
another cook pushed me into my car after my shift and unbuckled his pants food service is hell
then continue to tell me how pretty i am to the point where its uncomfortable i have said thank you and let them know its unwanted attention but it makes working uncomfortable because you dont know who youre going to run into when you clock in
you would not believe the number of times i was propositioned over the intercom at a drivethru specifically at the end of one order i asked if the customer needed anything else and he replied a blowjob would be nice i only ever had one male manager overhear and get angry on my behalf as opposed to laughing i also had more than one female coworker come to me and ask me to go out to the lobby to wipe tables change out the tea etc because male customers were leering at them asking when they got off work even catcalling them i wasnt allowed to say anything to them i dont think any manager ever made them leave i know in my time there there were no less than three male managers fired over sexual harassment
i worked at starbucks for almost three years in college when one of my coworkers and i reported our shift manager for sexual harassment we were told wed be laid off the following week
one night i was working behind the counter selling entry tickets at an arcade when this big family came in the grandpa who was probably in his late s early s was giving me creepy looks and when it was his turn to come up to the counter to get his wristband to enter the arcade he grabbed my hand stroked his finger up and down my ring finger whispered no ring and gave me this smile that made my stomach churn this was when i was and i looked like i was maybe or which means that there was absolutely no mistaking that i was underage
while working at crate and barrel customer service answering phones i had a man ask for gift box wherein he can place a cuff he purchased for his wife but the way described it he was more describing his penis it was awful and uncomfortable i never hung up on any customer besides him
i had a parttime job at a bar i was groped during a shift more recently i was tidying after a crowded party and slightly bent over whilst putting bottles in a bin and i felt someones presence behind me he was touching me inappropriately with his hands and looming over me silently this rattled me to my core
this one time a man came in with his son when i came to help them find what they were looking for the father then smiled at me in a suggestive way and asked if i could help them with underwear the father in front of his teenaged son who looked uncomfortable the whole time began asking me about myself in between he would comment on my hair on my smile how pretty i was i was a retail worker and the customer is always right even when they make you uncomfortable finally he turned to his son and he said thats it theres that blush a beautiful woman blushing is what men love in this disturbing sexual voice
my experiences with sexual harassment at my retail job ranges from verbal to physical but most of what i deal with is verbal and it comes from men of all ages ive come to almost expect it from teens to middleaged men but the most surprising was from a much older man around late s as i walked to the register to ring up him and his wife he looked me up and down and said ohhh sexy with a leering smile i was so angry because i didnt feel like i could stand up for myself for fear of my job or having worse reactions from the customer which could escalate the situation
a male customer stalked me for several weeks late last year culminating in an incident where he followed me around the shop shortly before close casually showing me what appeared to be a gun tucked into his waistband some of my male coworkers told me i was exaggerating or that the guy wasnt so bad another my manager at the time and one of the best men ive ever known bought me a knife and taught me how to use it when i told him what had happened
this happened when i was about and working in a popular retail store that sells tea and tea accessories i was alone in the store for a moment and a man comes in he starts talking to me and i go into my usual sales pitch then he randomly gets really close to me and tells me that my tits are really great he had gotten so close almost touching me after he left i was still shocked and shaking i still remember that as one of the most humiliating things that has ever happened to me and it makes me cringe every time i think about it
during the holidays id wear a santa hat to work and a male coworker once asked if i would give him my hat and sit on his lap and of course there were the guys who would ask me to massage their shoulders or feet while trying out the massage chairs calf massagers once when i refused to massage a mans feet he asked isnt that what they pay you for why else would they have women working in here after working in retail for six years i vowed i never would again women working in retail are walking targets that cant defend themselves for fear of losing their lousy low paying jobs
im currently working at starbucks and as a year old female i come across all types of guys men older men the good days are the days when they ask you if your single and why a pretty girl like you is should be alone the not so good days are the ones where they feel free to touch you a hand on your arm an unwanted hug a pat on my lower back a pat on my backside i cant say that ive been sexually harassed on the highest level still i feel like i should voice how inevitable it feels

i worked at a wellknown hardware store and a guy came up and started hitting on me just the usual comments about my appearance and asking for my number when i said i wasnt interested he got really pushy and demanded to know why when he was ready to go he asked in front of some other staff members if i could help him carry his stuff out to his car i didnt feel like i could say no without looking like a bad employee so i helped him out and he insisted on giving me his number and said cheerfully that he was a regular customer and hed see me again

they would also make comments about how much larger my breasts were since having a baby i felt so harassed and unsafe that i would dread going to work every day and i even had more than a few nervous breakdowns my husband was furious and i had to convince him not to take any drastic action so that i could be sure to have a good reference if i needed to find another job we had a long conversation and looked at our finances and decided the extra money wasnt worth the emotional distress

im a waitress and i get harassed daily by customers trying to order sexual harassment is part of the culture in every restaurant ive worked for the kitchen staff openly comments on female servers and female managers the saddest thing is that its never properly addressed because cooks always have more job security than servers ive even had a male manager tell me straight up that anybody can take that coke to that table but not everyone can make an omelette

i used to be a marketing director for a well known quick service restaurant i would have to work with the malls marketing manager to coordinate our advertisements and their placements he would constantly make little remarks about my outfits hair and makeup at one point he invited me out to drinks i was in my s and he was i politely declined but he refused to accept no for an answer he showed up every day i was in the store to ask me and when i wasnt in he berated one of my employees until they gave him my cell phone number i quit that job because i couldnt deal with him anymore and his superiors refused to reprimand him even after my own boss stepped in on my behalf

when i was i went to work at my first office job at a clothing manufacturer importer the warehouse manager would constantly talk about my big boobs he asked me if my back hurt from carrying them around stared all the time and it all made me very uncomfortable i did not say anything to my boss because my manager had only been there a short time and the warehouse manager had been there for many years i was afraid of losing my job which i needed it was a very small company so when i got married i put an invitation to my wedding reception on the bulletin board for my friends and sure enough he showed up with several other coworkers he came up to me and said i guess a blowjob is out of the question i couldnt believe it

i think inappropriate comments happen on a daily basis but i just didnt realize and for a long time have thought its my fault often people will play it off as banter and will accuse you of being too sensitive in a work environment im also the youngest person at work so i often get taken advantage of in all aspects after one of our work events i was sitting with a few colleagues and clients one client kept commenting on how my boobs tits were out he was drinking but thats no excuse this is an old man and im expected to be polite to clients i then went to sit on another table where he continued to pester me and insult me regarding my boobs in front of my colleagues and other clients

i was and had my first job as a hostess at an italian restaurant a few of the cooks and dishwashers would always stare and try to accidentally rub against the waitresses the men spoke limited english so the waitresses that also spoke spanish would tell them off when they touched them and the men would just laugh it was a daily occurrence one evening i had to go into the cold storage for something thus walking by one of the creepy dishwashers he rubbed my arm and smiled as i walked by i told him to stop jerked my arm away and went into the cold storage leaving the door ajar well he closed the door on me he probably only left me there for a few minutes but it was so scary
it was my second job ever working at a book store i was when i started and i was super excited to be there he was the assistant manager and the first person i met the day i came in for the interview he gave me the creeps from day one but i told myself i was just being dumb it was a quirky little bookshop and all the people who worked there were a little off i mostly worked nights and it would just be the two of us at first he just turned everything i said into a sexual joke and i thought whatever guys do that i was setting myself up for them i just needed to be more careful about what i would say soon though he was making comments about my body and why i only did well at my job because of how i looked that people only liked me because i was a chesty redhead i would try to ask him pertinent questions and he would say things like sorry i didnt hear you i was staring at your ass thankfully he never truly got physical though not for lack of trying and when i came back from school over break he had been fired for stealing i wish i had had the guts to report him then but i was new at the job and didnt want to cause trouble the shame that surrounds work harassment is infuriating even after he was gone i was scared to speak out for fear of being called a liar i wish this was the only story i had but two years later i could write a book most women in this country probably could
