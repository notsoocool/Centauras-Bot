    <h1>the breadth first search graph traversal algorithm is another one of the fundamental search algorithms used its
        graph
        runs in a time complexity of big over n plus m the breadthfirst search algorithm is particularly useful for one
        thing
        finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph a breadth first search stress and a
        node in a graph and expose its neighbouring nodes first before moving on to next items it different from a depth
        first
        search in the world and expose graph visit neighbours then you would visit on your neighbours than ever before
        moving on
        to the next nodes then we would visit of their neighbours in a layered manner it does this by meeting at you a
        which made it should be the next
        this is most easily seen with an example let's begin your search and
        once more adds to the Q on the left</h1>
